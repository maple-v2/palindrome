# 🧠 Palindrome Checker

This is a simple C program that checks whether a given word or number is a **palindrome** — meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards (like `madam`, `121`, or `racecar`).

## 🛠️ Features

- Supports strings and numbers
- Case-insensitive checks
- Clean, fast, and easy to use

## 🚀 How to Use

### Run from Source
Compile the code using GCC:
